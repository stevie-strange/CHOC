<h1>CHOC - Individual carbohydrates calculator

<h2>Abstract

The purpose of this project is to estimate the effective consumption of carbohydrates during a cycling activity. 
  The calculation is based on the individual results of the indirect calorimetry of a spirometry.
  Based on the indirect calorimetry a simple model is created that uses linear functions to approximate the carbohydrates consumption.
  
  The results can be used to determine the right nutrition for refueling after a workout or for competitions, e.g. how much carbohydrates are consumed holding a specific wattage.
